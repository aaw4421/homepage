                <p style="text-align: center; border-bottom: 1px gray dashed; padding-bottom: 1em;">If you're reffing a streamed match, you're <i>probably doing fine</i>, but if you want to go above and beyond, take note of these tips (which, really, are all just my opinion based on experience)!</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><p>As soon as you make the lobby, <code>!addref</code> the streamer. It also helps to ping the streamer on Discord telling them they're addreffed.</p></li>
                    <li><p>An optional courtesy is to create an "<strong>empty lobby</strong>" with the tourney abbreviation, like: <code>!mp make XYZ: (empty) vs (lobby)</code>. Switching to that lobby and back can fix issues in osu!tourney.</p></li>
                    <li><p>Make sure to <strong>promptly</strong> post the mp link or ID to the ref sheet and optionally send it to the streamer in Discord too. It gets added to a Twitch command and some streamers also join the lobby on IRC.</p></li>
                    <li><p>Unless told otherwise by hosts/admins, do <i>not</i> delay a match just because stream isn't ready yet. Stream can catch up later, and many players don't appreciate delays.</p></li>
                    <li><p>You have <i>complete control</i> of the song that plays on stream, using <code>!mp map [id]</code>. You may use this for <a href="https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1060431#osu/2220287">good</a> or <a href="https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1811253#osu/3715103">evil</a>. Some refs like to put on the TB while teams are rolling and banning.</p></li>
                    <li><p><strong>Even during warmups</strong>, there must be a player in slot 1 of the lobby for the tourney client.</p></li>
                    <li><p>Streamers may not know who "osuplayer423" is when they say "ban nm2". When asking for bans, use the <strong>team name or color</strong> rather than the captain's name, so the streamer can assign bans correctly!</p></li>
                    <li><p>Even if a team "instapicks" after a map, give some time before actually changing the map for the benefit of the commentators and streamer.</p></li>
                    <li><p>Watch the stream, if you can! Sometimes a player has tech issues at the start of a map, but maybe doesn't know they can ask for an <code>!mp abort</code>.</p></li>
                    <li><p>This is an obvious one, but just keep the ref sheet updated. If a streamer missed something or made a mistake in the overlay, they may use the ref sheet to check picks, bans, and winners.</p></li>
                    <li><p>Pay attention for Discord pings from commentators and streamers, which may alert you to issues or questions.</p></li>
                    <li><p>Especially when a team "instapicks", don't forget to post the current score and pick, which can act as a "sanity check" for the streamer.</p></li>
